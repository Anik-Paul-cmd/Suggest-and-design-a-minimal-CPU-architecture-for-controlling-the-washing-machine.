The objective of this project is to design an architecture of a washing machine which design can be used in the hardware of a washing machine. A washing machine (laundry machine, clothes washer, or washer) is a machine used to wash laundries, such as clothing and sheets. The term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids, and is performed by specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners.
